osgOcean v0.1
-------------

The library looks for shaders in the following directory:

resources/shaders/
resources/shaders/

Likewise with textures it will look for them in 

resources/textures/
resources/textures/

You should therefore make sure that resource directory is either
setup as a path variable or in the same path as the DLL or example
executable.

osgOcean also requires a copy of the FFTW library available from:

http://www.fftw.org/
